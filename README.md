- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonas El Gammal. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in theoretical physics at the University of Stavanger in Norway where I am researching stochastic gravitational
  wave signals from single field ultra slow roll inflation. Before coming to the beautiful town of Stavanger I studied physics at RWTH Aachen in 
  Germany. I am also working on machine learning for fast Bayesian inference together with my group from Aachen.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computational methods for cosmology, Bayesian inference, machine learning and numerical optimization methods.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning quantum field theory (thermal field theory), (deep) machine learning algorithms and their applications to gravitational wave detection
  and machine learning methods for interpolation and time series analysis.
