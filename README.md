- Hi, I’m Jonas El Gammal. I'm a PostDoc in Astrophysics at Insubria University in Como, Italy where I am researching how to make Pulsar Timing Array inference faster. Before that I was researching signals from second order scalar-induced GWs at the University of Stavanger in Norway. Before that, I studied physics at RWTH Aachen in 
  Germany. I am also working on machine learning for fast Bayesian inference together with my group from Aachen.
- I’m interested in computational methods for cosmology and astrophysics, Bayesian inference, machine learning and numerical optimization methods.
- I’m currently learning simulation based inference, jax, PTA statistics and methods for fast machine learning inference.
